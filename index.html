              Long ago, two young heroes named   
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER ONE ]
               and   
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER TWO ]
               were on summer break from school and dreamed of adventure. But specifically, a dragon type of adventure.  One summer morning,    
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER ONE ]
               and   
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER TWO ]
               discovered an old map of dragon caves and decided to investigate. After a long walk in the dark mountains, they found a cave. A cave which should have been dark and wet, but instead was glowing. Smoke came out of the entrance.

               said, "We must be careful, for a dragon loves its gold. Let's go take a look."

             Well the crafty dragon named   
            [ SCARY DRAGON NAME ]
                 could smell them from far away, but pretended to sleep. When the two young heroes entered his cave, the dragon grabbed them and said,

            You are trying to rob me. Now, I will keep you here forever to polish my gold, and bring me food, so that I will never, leave, my treasures. If you run, I will hunt you down.

               said, "This won't do. Our parents will be so angry."

            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER TWO ]
               worried, "I hope we don't run out of food and the dragon eats us." 
            1s
             The heroes were stranded and had to figure a way out. 
            1s
             After a few days of gathering chickens and rabbits for the dragon to eat,   
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER ONE ]
               said to the other, "I have an idea!" Whispering in low voices, the siblings smiled and said, "It's brilliant." From then on, at every meal,     
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER ONE ]
               would put a single gold coin in the dragon's food, and   
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER TWO ]
               would feed the beast. Since the dragon was so big, he ate a lot at every meal. Soon, he had eaten so much he could not move. There was too much gold in his belly! 
            1s
             The next morning, while the dragon slept,   
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER ONE ]
               and   
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER TWO ]
               made a run for it.   
            [ SCARY DRAGON NAME ]
               was so angry he blew fire in their direction, but was too heavy to chase them.

             Finally,   
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER ONE ]
               and   
            [ NAME FOR ADVENTURER TWO ]
               made it home. Their family and friends were so happy, they did not mind the burned clothes. The map of dragon caves was hidden in the attic for many years after.</p> -->
